This is 2nd capstone project from the Udemy HTML and CSS bootcamp.
Objective is to create a personal site that tells variety of stuffs about me. 
I designed this page to have 4 sections. 
-Header (hero section)
-My journey which list out my education and professional experiences 
-My skills 
-Footer

I tried to use most of HTML and CSS skills I learned from the previouls lectures. 
This includes CSS grid, flex box, text alignment, etc.
Unfortunately I didn't spend time for responsiveness because it is too much to worry about for given time.
